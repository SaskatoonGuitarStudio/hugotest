The Saskatoon Guitar Studio
===========================

The Saskatoon Guitar Studio is operated by Walter Hofmeister since 1987. In that time Mr. Hofmeister has been one of Saskatoon’s most sought-after guitar teachers. He has taught hundreds of students and has 30 years of experience teaching almost every musical style and has taught all ages from pre-school children to senior citizens.

Since graduating from the University of Saskatchewan with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1987, Mr. Hofmeister has received instruction from notable teachers such as John Sutherland (U.S.), and John Duarte (U.K.), and his playing has received high acclaim from such distinguished artists as Christopher Parkening (U.S.), Alexander Lagoya (France), and Hubert Kappel (Germany).

Walter Hofmeister has also been the guitar instructor for the University of Saskatchewan Department of Music since 2001.

In addition to his activities as a soloist, Mr. Hofmeister also performs with harpist Chris Lindgren (Artissimo Duo), and also his family folk group Willoughby Widdershins. Walter has also appeared as guest soloist with the Prairie Virtuosi Orchestra, and has worked with many of Saskatoon’s finest musicians.
