    <div align="start" class="content"><h2 id="the-lessons">The Lessons</h2>
<p>The lessons are private sessions that last 30 minutes each, once a week at the same appointed time. For music instruction, experience has proven that private lessons are the most effective, because each individual is able to work at his/her own speed and the courses can be tailored to each individual. As well supplemental material can be supplied to students who need more work in a particular area. The regular instruction season coincides with the school year: September until June. Holidays are also designed to coincide with the school year with longer holidays scheduled at Christmas and Easter.</p>
<h3 id="instruments">Instruments</h3>
<p>The instrument you play is the most important piece of equipment in your studies.</p>
<p>Instruction can be provided on acoustic (steel string, or nylon stringed),or electric instruments.</p>
<p>If you don’t own an instrument or have one that you aren’t too sure about, give me a call. I would be happy to make a recommendation for you.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-through-projects">Motivation Through Projects</h3>
<p>At the Saskatoon Guitar Studio there are a number of services and events that are offered to help motivate students. The studio encourages students to take part in musical projects that include: recording projects, the Saskatoon Music Festival, RCM exams, ensemble, and student recitals (at the end of the school year). Participation in all of these events is optional, these activities are provided to enhance your program.</p>
<h3 id="tuition">Tuition</h3>
<p>Tuition is paid by post-dated bi-monthly cheques. A fee schedule will be provided at your first lesson.</p>
<h3 id="courses">Courses</h3>
<p>Courses are able to accommodate all levels of proficiency from beginner to advanced. The programs at the Saskatoon Guitar Studio are designed to be well rounded educational courses developing all areas of musicianship including: music notation reading, rhythmic accuracy, listening skills, tuning, music theory, and training the hands to work properly on the instrument.</p>
<p>All this is accomplished using familiar musical examples that are fun, challenging, and stimulating. As a student advances, it is then possible to branch out into more specific styles of music, and their special techniques.</p>
<p>Styles to choose from include: folk, country, rock, and finger styles (folk, Latin American, flamenco, and classical).</p>
